# Notes

## Description

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

```
friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
```

Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

## Domain 
- input: list of strings
- output: list of strings
- Rules:
    - output list of strings only contains strings with 4 letters
